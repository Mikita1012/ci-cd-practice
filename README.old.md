Basics of CI/CD

cloned a newly made repo on my github, made a new branch (readme-update) and now will be committing these changes in README file. 
A PR is not about pulling code to your computer — it's about proposing a merge between branches.
That’s why even after pushing, you "request a pull" into the mainline branch.
